# CS50 Final Project - Food Ordering Website (EZfood)
This is the final project of CS50 course. It is a simple food ordering website implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Most of the content of the website is included in the first page and different sections are accessible using the top nav bar. Some of the sections in the webpage are as follows:
- Navbar: gives the user this ability to move between different sections.
- Slideshow: illustrates some photos and information about the restaurant's top meals.
- About us: some information about the owners' related background and service they are providing. 
- Menu: the main part of the website which includes the photos and description of different possible items to choose from. Every item has got an order button which is used to add it to the cart. The menu is separated to different parts based on the food type and by clicking on each one of them, we can see the coresponding items.
- Contact us: a simple form where the user can ask questions, reserve a date, share his experience and etc.
